This is the website for the Molecular Quantum Metrology group at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/amopp/atomic-molecular-optical-and-positron-physics). 

We are an experimental group interested in developing tools and techniques to control molecules at the quantum level and using this control to perform measurements which can probe for new physics.
